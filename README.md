## How to Get Involved
* You can find and chat with us on **#tensorflow** @ Clojurians Slack. [Get an invite here.](http://clojurians.net/)
* If you find bugs / have feature requests, feel free to make an issue here on GitHub. For bugs, please provide sample
code where possible for reproducing the issue. Also, be sure to let us know what environment (OS, Java version, CLJ version,
etc.) you're using.

## Usage

This library is available via Clojars: `[tensorflow-clj "0.1"]`
